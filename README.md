# Night City ARG
<a href="nightcity.digital">Night City Digital</a> is a project hosted on Github as a solo project.
Webpage is static, mostly used for general information about the tabletop game's sessions, or anything
else the GM would like to add for flavor. 
<br><br>
Feel free to fork for your own game 
currently suggested changes are once a week or once per session. Changes will have to be done
on the raw html files as there is no back-end connectivity. Though it should be easily done as 
there is not much complex code on the index page.

# To do List
<br>Node.js connections for player login and messages.
